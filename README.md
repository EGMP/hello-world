Hi! I'm Erin! I'm a PhD student in Biological and Environmental Engineering! I use R to process raw data output from lab instruments, do data analysis, and make plots. Basically, make sense of what lab equipment spits out, look for trends and interesting relationships, and pretty pictures!!! This is the second time I have taught this course and the first time I am teaching it as an online course, so let me know what you like and don't like!
